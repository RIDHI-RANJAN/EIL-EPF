FUTURE SCOPE
 
1. Upon further modifications , this project will allow the companies and the interested parties to access information of students from a particular field or a particular college with similar fields or the fields they require. It can also be used to filter results based on some given conditions.

2. Submitting information on behalf of students will become easier as they will not be required to visit different pages to fill in their details and instead will be able to submit their details in one single page.

3. The parties concerned with the data can use this single database for any data they may require.
